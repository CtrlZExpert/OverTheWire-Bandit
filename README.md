# OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 00–24)

This repository is a concise portfolio piece showing practical Linux skills I built by completing **OverTheWire Bandit Levels 00–24**.
I approached each level like an IT ticket: identify the problem, run commands to solve it, and record what I learned.

**What this shows:**

- Core Linux skills (SSH, files, permissions, searching, compression)
- Networking basics (`nc`, `nmap`, `openssl`)
- Automation and troubleshooting (loops, cron jobs, `find` usage)
- A security-aware mindset (SSH keys, setuid, safe remote access)

Each level file contains:
- **Challenge** — what the task asked
- **Solution** — commands I used (no scripts, copy-paste ready)
- **What I Learned** — the practical skill I gained
- **Key Takeaway** — why this matters for IT roles

## Note to Recruiters

This project demonstrates my ability to work through real Linux troubleshooting scenarios in a structured way.  
Each level highlights a specific skill—such as secure remote access, file permissions, or process automation—that directly applies to IT support and system administration.  

If you'd like to validate these skills, I can walk through selected levels in a short technical conversation or demo.  
The challenges and solutions here are practical, clear, and aligned with what you would expect from a motivated junior system administrator or service desk professional.
