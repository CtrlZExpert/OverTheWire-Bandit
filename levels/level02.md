    # Level 02 â€” Tricky filenames

    ### Challenge
    Read a file that starts with a dash (`-`).

    ### Solution
    ```bash
    ls
cat ./-
    ```

    ### What I Learned
    Using `./` tells the shell to treat the name as a file.

    ### Key Takeaway
    I confirm file paths when names are unusual.
